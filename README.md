Back in my fifth project on Alarm Clock (no GUI) I mentioned that I discovered a new way to learn programming languages: Through the learning of libraries.

Through applying for IT internships and some readups online I also realised some popular libraries that are a must-know as professional skills in Python in the working world. Said libraries include NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib so here they are.

I'm sure what I posed here definitely isn't everything there is about the libraries and there is a good chance that I may just be scratching the surface on the knowledge and the contents of these libraries. I'll keep learning as time goes on on what there is to know.

Everything in Python is an object, noticed a lot of programming languages are object oriented, while only a few like C are solely using primitive data types like int float char etc, that are data with no attributes or properties (can put in GitHub readme)

**1. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Learning**

What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP)?

From online: "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a computer programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic."

The code that I put into the 'Object_Oriented_Programming_(OOP)_learn' folder is taken from and in order of this playlist's contents.

**2. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Practices**

Source(s): https://pynative.com/python-object-oriented-programming-oop-exercise/ (PyNative)

The coding excercises I put into 'Object_Oriented_Programming_(OOP)_practice' folder is taken from and in order of this website's contents.

Practices done by myself. Solutions that look quite different from my answers (or if my answers are wrong) I have attached the solutions in the folder as well.

## Thoughts after the learning journey
Learnt some stuff surrounding the context behind these 3 libraries. Numpy serves as the base that Pandas and Matplotlib are built on. 

An important thing I learnt through learning these Python Libraries is that as a programmer you are not expected to remember every single command and the context in a library since it is quite impossible, even for veteran coders. But I feel what makes them a veteran is that while coding they have this instinct that tells them that there is various possible ways/solutions to do the code/bug. Even if they can't remember the precise way to do it they can always google it up and find what they want. Beginners might not even know what they don't know, and I feel this is what seperates veteran from new programmers. So keep coding, in order to get this 'instinct' to improve your coding skills!

A handy way to search for a command/codes in a documentation you are looking for is through using the web's 'Word Search'. Example: You want to figure out how to label pie chart in Matplotlib, but don't know the command. You can simply word search label, and see if any 'Label' words pops up in the website either in the description of a code or if you're lucky, the command for label might just be 'Label'.
